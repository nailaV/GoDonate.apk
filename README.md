GoDonate is a web application that originated as an idea for a college project. It was developed using the .NET Framework, with the backend written in C# and the frontend in Angular. This was our first encounter with WebAPI and such data transfer methods.

The application was designed as a platform for donating money, not strictly for humanitarian purposes, but also as a means of supporting like-minded individuals, sponsoring students, and similar purposes. There are two types of users: administrators and end users (donors/donation recipients).

End users can add a limited number of their donation stories while being able to donate money an unlimited number of times. They can manage their payment cards and leave comments on each story. Administrators manage users, with a tabular view of all logged-in users and the ability to make modifications to their profiles.

The application was created by two beginner students, and we are aware that there is plenty of room for improvement.
